    <h3>Visual exploration</h3>  
    <p class="normal">Including photography, illustration, sketching, hand-drawing, concept art</p>
<p>positively related to my design career, creative activities like photography, painting, sketching, hand-drawing, and concept art are my hobbies. I also love to travel to different countries to figure out the fantastic scenes worldwide and record them by photo, video, and hand-drawing. Here is some sample of my hand-drawing pieces.</p>

    <h3>ACG lover (Animation, comic, game)</h3>  
        <p>The ACG is an abbreviation of "<b>A</b>nime, <b>C</b>omic and <b>G</b>ames", used in some subcultures ofChina. When I am was a kid, animations and games attract me a lot, the different art styles in energy impact me a lot, and I gradually learn drawing by myself and trying to produce animation. However, the animations left me a huge impact, which leads my career path to a designer. As an art form that has only existed in the digital space, video games, and animations, comics genuinely collide art and science. In my leisure time, enjoy digital art release stress and learn a lot form the art.</p>

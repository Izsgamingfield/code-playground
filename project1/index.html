    <p class="normal">Introduction</p>
<p>I design engaging experiences within user-centric systems that impact people. I'm currently a Master of Fine Arts student at Rochester Institute of Technology, will graduate in May  2021. I have a lot of experience in the design studio and have been working in different places. I already have a lot of work and project engagement experience. Last year, I had a one-year full-time internship experience in Siemens Cooperate Technology as a Visual/UX designer. I mainly worked on all on-hands work in a two-person design team. My responsibilities included experience design, user interface design, user research, creating wireframes and flows, prototyping and testing. My hobbies are high related to my job. I love everything related to creativity, like photography, illustration, sketching, hand-drawing, concept art. I am also a fan of animation, games, and comics.</p>

    <p class="normal">About</p>
<p>This site is a personal site showing my professional skills and my design-related hobbies for potential employers. In May 2021, I will graduate with a Master of Fine Arts degree in Visual Communication Design (Interaction Option). I would be particularly interested in the full-time position related to UI/UX design. I have a strong background in user experience design, especially how it combines with design strategy, prototyping, user research, and interface design. I believe that these skills and experiences would help implement the user experience and the manufacturing of product design. </p>

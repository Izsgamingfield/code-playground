    Design ethics concerns moral behavior and responsible choices in the practice of design. It guides how designers work with clients, colleagues, and the end users of products, how they conduct the design process, how they determine the features of products, and how they assess the ethical significance or moral worth of the products that result from the activity of designing.<br><br>
    In other words, ethical design is about the “goodness”—in terms of benefit to individuals, society, and the world—of how we collaborate, how we practice our work, and what we create. There’s never a black-and-white answer for whether design is good or bad, yet there are a number of areas for designers to focus on when considering ethics.</p>
<h3>USABILITY</h3> 
    <p>Nowadays usability has conquered a spot as a basic requirement for each interface; unusable products are considered design failures. And rightly so; we have a moral obligation as designers to create products that are intuitive, safe, and free from possibly life-threatening errors. We were all reminded of usability’s importance by last year’s <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/error-prevention/" target="_blank" >accidental nuclear strike warning </a> in Hawaii. What if, instead of a false-positive, the operator had broadcasted a false-negative?
</p>    
    <h3>ACCESSIBILITY</h3>
    <p>Like usability, the inclusive design has become a standard item in the requirement list of many designers and companies. Accessible design benefits all, as it attempts to cover as many needs and capabilities as possible. Yet for each design project, there are still a lot of tricky questions to answer. Who gets to benefit from our solutions? Who is (un)intentionally left out? Who falls outside the “target customer segment”?</p>
<h3>PRIVACY</h3>
    <p>As we’re progressing into the Data Age, the topic of privacy has become almost synonymous with design ethics. There’s a reason why more and more people use <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/traffic" target="_blank" >DuckDuckGoas</a> an alternative search engine to Google. Corporations have access to an abundance of personal information about consumers, and as designers we have the privilege—and responsibility—of using this information to shape products and services. We have to consider how much information is strictly necessary and how much people are willing to give up in exchange for services. And how can we make people aware of the potential risks without<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10603-018-9399-7" target="_blank" > overloading</a> them.</p>
<h3>USER INVOLVEMENT</h3>
    <p>Overlapping largely with privacy, this focus area is about how we deal with our users and what we do with the data that we collect from them. IDEO has recently published <a href="https://lbodre.ideo.com/" target="_blank" ><i>The Little Book of Design Research Ethics</i></a>, which provides a comprehensive overview of the core principles and guidelines we should follow when conducting design research.
</p>
<h3>PERSUASION</h3>
    <p>Ethics related to persuasion is about to what extent we may influence the behavior and thoughts of our users. It doesn’t take much to bring acceptably, “white hat” persuasion into gray or even dark territories. Conversion optimization, for example, can easily turn into “How do we squeeze out more revenue from our customers by turning their unconsciousness against them. Prime examples include Netflix, which convinces us to watch, watch, and watch even more, and Booking.com, which barrages our senses with urgency and social pressure.</p>
<h3>FOCUS</h3>
    <p>The current digital landscape is addictive, distracting, and competing for attention. Designing for focus is about responsibly handling people’s most valuable resource: time. Our challenge is to limit everything that disrupts our users’ attention, lower the addictiveness of products, and create calmness. The Center for Humane Technology has started a useful list of <a href="http://humanetech.com/resources" target="_blank" >resources</a> for this purpose.</p>
<h3>SUSTAINABILITY</h3>
    <p>What’s the impact of our work on the world’s environment, resources, and climate? Instead of continuously adding new features in the unrelenting scrum treadmill, how could we design for fewer? We’re in the position to create responsible digital solutions that enable sustainable consumer behavior and prevent overconsumption.</p>
<h3>SOCIETY</h3>
        <p>The <a href="https://ledger.humanetech.com/" target="_blank" >Ledger of Harms</a> of the Center for Human Technology is a work-in-progress collection of the negative impacts that digital technology has on society, including topics such as relationships, mental health, and democracy. Designers who are mindful of society consider the impact of their work on the global economy, communities, politics, and health.</p>
